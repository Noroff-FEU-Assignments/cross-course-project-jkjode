        <h3>Rainydays was established in 1492.</h3>

        <h3>While Cristopher Columbus was sailing to what he thought to be India, one of his whiny officers got tired of the constant weather changes the Atlantic had to offer.</h3>
          
          <h3>He found himself Cold, warm, dry, wet and everything at once and sought to find a solution.</h3>
          
          <h3>Tired of listening to Cristopher, he locked himself up in his cabin and spent the whole journey exploring solutions for the perfect jacket.</h3>
          
          <h3>He never found this solution and he did not found our company either.</h3>
          
          <h3>We were established our company just a few years ago with our own technology and patents. 
          There were no such things back in 1492, but I got you reading this far, right?</h3>
          
          <h3>The only limit you will have with our jackets is your own body. But even you will be more fit, agile and strong using our jackets!</h3>
          
          <h3>We work everyday to make our Products better, warmer, dryer, more comfortable and breatheble. They cool you down when hot due to the patented cooling system called Rainydays Chill and heat you in cool weathers with patent pending Rainydays Heat functionality.</h3>
